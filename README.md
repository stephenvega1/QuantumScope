! Let’s compare the two approaches:

Conceptual Similarities:
Matrix Operations and Noise: Both approaches use matrix operations with added Gaussian noise to simulate teleportation detection.
Object Detection: Both methods detect objects based on the results of the matrix operations.
Random Object Properties: In both cases, the detected objects have random coordinates and sizes.
Differences:
Visualization:
Kivy Approach: Uses Kivy to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the detected objects. Objects are displayed as moving ellipses on a radar-like background.
Non-Kivy Approach: Outputs the detected objects’ coordinates and sizes to the console without any graphical visualization.
Object Movement:
Kivy Approach: Includes a MovingObject class to simulate the movement of objects within the radar area.
Non-Kivy Approach: Does not simulate object movement; it only detects and prints the objects’ initial positions and sizes.
Complexity:
Kivy Approach: More complex due to the graphical visualization and object movement simulation.
Non-Kivy Approach: Simpler and focuses solely on the detection logic without any GUI elements.
Summary:
The core concept of using matrix operations and noise for teleportation detection remains the same in both approaches. The primary difference lies in how the results are presented and whether object movement is simulated. The Kivy approach provides a more interactive and visual representation, while the non-Kivy approach is a straightforward console-based implementation.

for education purpose and research 
it adds simulated objects to detect hope it can be used for researching ways to create a teleporation useing matrix and entropy
